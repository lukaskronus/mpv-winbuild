Subject: [FFmpeg-devel] [PATCH v2] avformat/http: Add max_requested_size option

From https://patchwork.ffmpeg.org/project/ffmpeg/patch/20250329222809.606230-2-ffmpeg@fratti.ch/

In some cases, webservers may return content more quickly if one sends many
small requests rather than one big request. Clients may wish to opt-in to this
workaround.

For this purpose, add a max_requested_size AVOption, which returns EOF if
max_requested_size is exceeded, causing a new request with an offset to be
issued.

In particular, this hack is useful for mpv, where it can be used to bypass
YouTube's throttling.
